The Wine_Data_Exploration.ipynb notebook contains implementations of three essential machine learning algorithms: K-Means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Naive Bayes classification. This notebook covers the following:

* Detailed implementations of K-Means, PCA, and Naive Bayes

* Visualizations and evaluation of the results for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and classification

**Key Features:**

**1. K-Means Clustering**

* Clusters wines based on chemical properties using K-Means

* Inertia and silhouette methods to determine the optimal number of clusters

* Visualization of clustering results
  
**2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

* Reduces the dimensionality of the dataset for easier visualization and interpretation
  
* Explains variance captured by principal components and visualizes the data in the reduced space
  
**3. Naive Bayes Classification**

* Implements Naive Bayes to classify wines into their respective categories

* Evaluates the classifier using metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, and visualizations of train and test data sets
